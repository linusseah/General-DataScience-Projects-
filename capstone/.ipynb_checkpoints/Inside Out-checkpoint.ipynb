    "# Inside Out: classifying emotions based on textual input\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary> Problem statement </summary>\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Lack of explicit emotional input for digital recommendations: \n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations are often made in the absence of emotional considerations, which could lead to poor targeting \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Costly and time-consuming to gather mass implicit feedback: \n",
    "\n",
    "Information on the emotional response to an event (could be a press release, a public speech etc) could be helpful for better decision making (e.g. reactions toward a certain action of policy) but obtaining this implicit feedback in real-time and on a mass level is often costly and time-consuming, if even possible. While explicit emotional feedback can be gained through social media platforms like facebook it would be more powerful if we could get that same analysis implicitly based on individual's textual input on publicly accessible platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preventative action: \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunate events like mass-killings are often preceded by telling messages indicative of troubled emotions before the incidents happen but are usually only discovered only post-mortem.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Augmented sentiment analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "Current sentiment analysis is usually binary. However, even within the broad categories of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ it would be helpful to understand what kind of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ in order to respond more appropriately \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Facilitating better human interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Different people are wired differently and communicate in ways that might get easily misconstrued, leading to relationship breakdowns. This model hopes to smoothen some of those kinks by adding an additional layer of perspective on how someone might be feeling or why they might be writing that way (e.g. personality type) so that individuals can better understand each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Difficulty in interpreting specifically short, informal / social-media based / localised textual input:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a few existing ML models and rule-based NLP libraries out there that perform well on more formal textual structures (academic writing etc where traditional semantics are adhered to) However, informal/unstructured textual input often deviates from these semantic norms and often include other lexical structures that are dynamic and localised in nature - causing said ML models / rule based systems to perform poorly on them. Given that a large proportion of (textual)data that reveal real-time information is unstructured, there should be more emphasis on developing a model/rule-based system that specialises in 'understanding' unstructured data. \n",

    "- maybe recommendation systems (KIV. Stretch output)\n",

    "\n",
    ">Bonus: train against both emotion and personality (reason being - the same textual output from 2 ppl of differing personalities could be interpreted as stemming from different emotional states) \n",
    "\n",
    "> define own specific list of 'identifers' for each emotional class type (i.e. let the NLP do the tagging instead of relying on pre-classified tags) not sure how but maybe can use VADER (or some other rule based system) to provide the valences of each sentence then use an unsupervised learning based machine learning technique to form clusters based on the valence data (each emotion type could have a particular valence score). Based on clusters formed, can start making sense of it to determine whether it corresponds with a particular emotion - but as Vader/Hutto themselves concluded in thier paper, ML approach is difficult due to the lack of comprehensive training sets and secondly, transparency of how the models have processed the data. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Used for more granular sentiment analysis (for policy makers, anything… that find an emotional response informative): (stretch goal: input a query e.g. US elections. backend scraper will scrape form chosen medium e.g. twitter for all US election based tweets, clean it up and run multiple tweets through the model and produce a emotion % score e.g. 40% happy, 20% angry, 20% fear, 20% neutral etc) so this pivots from analyzing a single text input to multiple text inputs at once \n",

    "7. Smoothen interactions / build community at workplaces: foster better understanding and empathy btw individuals of different personalities types who may have different ways of interacting and working. A practical application could be say, an end user running an email through the classifier to retrieve some info on the emotional state and perosnality type of the sender (many atimes terse sonuding emails could be construed as unfriendliness but if sender is a INTJ or someth then receiver can better understand that perhaps that is just the way INTJ's tend to interact)  \n",

    "    \n",
    "1. Text as a pure emotion analyser would be difficult as there is so much that is lost when we exclude the verbal intonations, facial expressions etc so can think about how you can compensate for those things in your analysis (e.g. picking up bold, or italics, exclamations, or emojis etc) could also consider how I can maybe augment the dataset with other features to better predict for emotion? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. a single textual input could referce multiple emotional states at varying points in time e.g. someone recouting his or her emotions throughout the day. How to reconcile this? the overall emotional state on balance? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. things like sarcasm, or passive-aggressiveness would be hard to detect and even so, to classify as a particular emotion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. pejoratives (words expressed as neutral or even positive statements to mask a negative sentiment) e.g. 'the chicken had a unique taste... or his idea was interesting...\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. picking up emotional-nuances expressed in non-textual cues like emoticons or accents like bold, italics etc e.g. ... or :>, **angry** etc \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. slang is localised. so the model would probably not perform well in different cultural contexts unless it is trained on multiple localised datasets (e.g. American slang used to connote certain emotions are not the same as those that Singaporeans would use) slang is also dynamic in nature (this is why things like urban dictionary exist because new words are always getting added to it) this also means that the model will have to be continuously trained on new datasets/ add new words to an emotion library \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. lexical methods are context specific; vocab that connotes specific emotion differ from setting to setting. (e.g. lexical anaylsis for social media would be alot more slang/emoticon heavy whereas the same for formal writing would not) So a model trained on a social media based dataset would probably not do as well when interpreting the emotions of formal prose. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. humans experience complex emotions (it's hard enough for a human to accurately interpret emotion, not to mention computers...) so it would be important to objectively quantify that complex expression in some way. Also to figure out which emotions are compatible with each other and which aren't. (e.g. you can be both happy and excited at the same time... but happy and angry? ... possible?) \"locating your current emotional state in a N-dimensional emotional plane - plotted over time would form your emotional cloud \"\n",

    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. dealing with imbalanced classes of emotions (general emotions like joy or sadness would be classified far more often than more nuanced ones like emptiness..) more broadly speaking, the process of classifying emotions is tricky because sometimes we don't even know how to particularize our emotions in words.  \n",
    "\n",

    "10. dataset is currently being trained largely on individual sentences. Not sure how well the model would perform on larger chunks of texs e.g. paragraphs - **find some way to split the analysis up to the sentence? e.g. within paragraphs**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. will cleaning technique differ depending on subsequent method of analysis adopted? (e.g. if VADER uses emoticons and Caps to detect valence then we probably shouldnt strip the text of non-textual input and lowercase everything)\n",

Another possbility could be to try and optimize my code further so that it can be loaded into memory..but that might take a while. (A possible drastic measure could also be to just remove the text cleaning function altogether since i think NLTK takes up quite alot of space.. and see whether it works after removing it) -> realised that this cannot be done too because we still need NLTK's sent tokenize function...(very troublesome to figure out how to split the sentences manually) \n",
