    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - you are a part of a team that tracks statewide participation and recommends where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates. Your presentation and report should be geared toward non-technical executives with the College Board and you will use the provided data and outside research to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rate in a state of your choice.\n",

    "### Executive Summary: \n",
    "\n",
    "We worked with 4 data sets for this exercise: ACT and SAT scores for 2017 and 2018. \n",
    "\n",
    "We performed some exploratory data analysis to ensure the integrity of the data and to get a sensing of the general distribution of the various data points.   \n",
    "\n",
    "After removing some errant values, we merged all 4 datasets into a combined dataframe to carry out further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plotted histograms and studied the different metrics for skewness. Explored relationships further by running regressions and plotting boxplot diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the more interesting observations are the strongly negative correlation between:\n",
    "- ACT and SAT participation %\n",
    "- ACT and SAT participation % and average total/composite scores respectively \n",
    "- Colorado's SAT and ACT participation% across 2017 and 2018 swapped\n",
    "\n",
    "These indicate the substitutionary nature of the SAT and ACT tests, and point towards a mandate in certain states to take the test, hence skewing the overall test scores. \n",

    "### Conclusion/Recommendations: \n",
    "\n",
    "Alaska and Oregon would be my primary candidates for sponsorship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Primary funnels:\n",
    "1) Exclude all states with high SAT participation rates  \n",
    "Reason: self explanatory as states with already high SAT rates will probably yield only marginal returns with incremental sponsorship \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Exclude all states with high ACT participation rates \n",
    "Reason: Since you would only need to do either the SAT or the ACT to gain admission to college, there is no need to push for higher participation rates in states where ACT participation rates are already high - this also makes sense from a business perspective as there is less competition to be had in states where both the SAT and ACT participation rates are low, all else being equal. (since students with limited resources and who are already taking the ACT need to be persuaded to either switch to the SAT or take both tests) \n",
    "Further justification is that states where ACT rates are high are usually a where ACT tests are state mandated it would thus not make commercial sense to compete in these states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary funnels (deciding factor in event of tie):\n",
    "3) Amongst the remaining states, potentially exclude lower performing states (but this is up for discussion depending on stated objectives e.g. perhaps sponsors want to fund higher performing states) + check for improvement of test scores between 2017 and 2018 \n",
    "Reason: could select for states that have shown improvement in test scores from 2017 to 2018 as being indicative of being a high potential state. \n",
    "same could be said for states that have high scores but low participation \n",
    "however an alternative argument could be that states with low scores and low participation are the ones in need of the greatest need of extra support. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) check out eligible student populations \n",
    "Reason: student population size in shortlisted states - state with smaller student population could potentially yield higher increases in participation rates per dollar spent. sponsorship per student would also be higher which could result in higher overall test scores - bonus outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "My final choice would be Alaska. Although both states have seen a similar increment in 5% of SAT % from 17 to 18, Alaska has the lower SAT participation % of the two. However, ACT rates are declining for Alaska whereas it is increasing for Oregon, possibly indicating that individuals are more open to switching from ACT to the SAT in Alaska compared to Oregon.\n",
